<p>Recently, I coded the handler of some usual finger gestures on phones:</p> <ul><li><p>Zoom in/zoom out</p> <p>For zooming, I simply call the desktop handler of - and + that respectively reduces the font size (making more cells visible) and increases the font size. Because my handler is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics">discrete</a>, so is the handling of zooming. This may look cheap compared to usual games, but hey it’s really impossible to do better without entirely changing the game’s display code.</p></li><li><p>Pan</p> <p>A pan gesture consists in posing a finger on the screen, and then moving it without lifting it. In <em>And My Axe!</em>, pan allows to look around the map, by moving the display, so that it isn’t centered on the player, but centered on the location reached by starting from the player, and following the pan gesture. <em>pan</em> was slightly tartelette aux concombres to implement, because <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Gesture-detection">libgdx’s interface</a> provides the coordinates-delta since the last pan callback, not since the first pan callback <em>in this pan session</em>. Hence I have to accumulate the deltas on my own and detect pan sessions.</p></li><li>Fling <br>A fling gesture is like a mouse scroll, except that it can be in the four cardinal directions. No matter the direction, I handle fling by sliding a panel (in the fling’s direction, yeah neat) proposing three options: Resume, Save and Quit, Quit without Saving. Sliding is done using libgdx’s <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Scene2d#actions">actions</a>: I simply set the panel outside the screen initially, and use an action to make it slide to its desired location. The handler of buttons isn’t sliding aware, so you can click on a button’s destination, before it actually reaches it. No big deal.</li></ul> <p>I was able to test gestures on an <a href="http://www.archos.com/">Archos</a> phone, because a schoolmate (at the time we were at school..) could get me one. He works at Archos in Paris, and they were throwing away development phones, so he set one aside for me. Big up to him, and here’s a photo of the game on the phone:</p> <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ebpFTkO.jpg" alt="And My Axe! on a phone" title=""></p> <blockquote>  <p>Written with <a href="https://stackedit.io/">StackEdit</a>.</p></blockquote>
