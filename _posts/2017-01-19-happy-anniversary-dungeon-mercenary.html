<p>On this day, one year ago, I announced the first version of <a href="http://www.schplaf.org/hgames/">Dungeon Mercenary</a> on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/brogueforum/comments/41olu7/new_runicsbased_roguelike_dungeon_mercenary/?st=iy4grte2&amp;sh=139ea5e0">brogue’s reddit</a>. In this post, I’ll discuss how this year went.</p> <h3 id="statistics-about-this-first-year">Statistics about this first year</h3> <p>I’ve released the game for almost a year on:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://hgames.itch.io/dungeon-mercenary">itch.io</a> where it gathered 2574 views (which includes loading the HTML5 version) of the game, 153 downloads (desktop version of the game), and <em>one</em> 1€ donation (meaning after paypal and itch, I earned 60 cents).</li><li><a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/dungeon-mercenary/151692">GameJolt</a> where it gathered 3100 views and 1100 plays (I don’t know if this is solely HTML5 or if it counts downloads too). The game had a strong start on GameJolt as any new game is featured on GameJolt’s front page during a week. During this week I already got more than 1000 views. If I had known that beforehand, maybe I would have waited a bit more to release a more polished game. I have 0.91€ balance, thanks to the ads that GameJolt serve.</li></ul> <p>This means I made 1,50€ in one year with Dungeon Mercenary. Not even a coffee in <em>Paris Gare de l’Est</em>… Tomorrow’s not the day I’ll quit my day job to become an indie developer (not that it’s a surprise though ^^).</p> <p>I almost never had any feedback from itch, neither from itch’s developers, nor from players on itch. On GameJolt though, the game got ranked 51 times (for an average of 3,6 stars (out of 5)), gathered 51 followers, I’ve had a number of exchanges with players, and the game was selected by the website for a <a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/thejolties2016">competition</a> where it ended up something like <a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/thejolties2016/games/dungeon-mercenary/151692">16/75</a> (not bad for an ASCII game I believe). I was affected once by a bug on GameJolt’s website, and it got immediately fixed after I notified <a href="https://twitter.com/TheyTookCROS">them</a>; so kuddos GameJolt.</p> <p>itch gives statistics about how people find the game:</p> <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ybxmDAm.png" alt="" title=""></p> <p>This is pretty depressing, as itch’s “gimme a random game” button is the #1 source of this. The second source of hits are people coming from my website on schplaf.org. The third (and last  relevant, I believe) entry is the HTML5 tag. This means that the possibility of compiling to Javascript that <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libgdx</a> offers is pretty relevant.</p> <h3 id="thoughts-on-this-year">Thoughts on this year</h3> <ul><li>I learnt quite a lot on <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libgdx</a>, the Java library I rely upon for display. I learnt about the <a href="http://www.gwtproject.org/">Google Web Toolkit</a> library (which allows me to release to HTML5). Both are great tools.</li><li>Being able to ship to a lot of platform (but especially HTML5) is important. Having a standalone .exe for Windows players is important. No one will install anything to run your game, no matter how fancy it is.</li><li>It is very hard to get feedback and build a community. Only 3 players consistently give me feedback/write a comment/tell something after a new release. Maybe I’m not good at attracting players. Generally speaking, <a href="https://twitter.com/hgamesdev">twitter</a> seems like a good tool communicate, as they are <strong>a lot</strong> of people there. For more roguelike-focused people, reddit’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/">roguelikedev</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/">roguelike</a> seem like the place where there are many people, oh and also <a href="http://www.roguebasin.com/">roguebasin</a>. Every time I release, I see hits on my webpage coming from roguebasin.</li><li>No one ever did a <em>let’s play</em> or a review/post about Dungeon Mercenary, except for <a href="http://www.goodolddays.net/article/id%2C21/TGOD+Game+Challenge+2016.html?s=689b8874bb21ebf9c8df08c489ab9971afdb8005">one guy</a> that was in a retro-gaming challenge, for the “a retro game in 2016” entry.</li><li>Being a dad and neither a slacker nor at home nor at work means it is tremendously difficult to progress. Every release is a miracle, because I need like a big hour straight to build it, upload it and announce it everywhere.</li></ul> <h3 id="releases">Releases</h3> <p>Since the first release I’ve made 20 releases. Here’s some the new things that came along the year:</p> <ul><li><p>February 2016, the ‘mud’ levels (and the release on <a href="https://hgames.itch.io/dungeon-mercenary">itch.io</a>) <br><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CbRcfJpXIAQix_O.png" alt="" title=""></p></li><li><p>March 2016,  changed the font of the top level ‘text area’ <br><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CcnB0axWoAAU5Dp.jpg" alt="" title=""></p></li><li><p>May 2016, generated first special areas cemeteries <br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/6GYLYYw.png" alt="" title=""></p></li><li><p>June 2016, changed the font of in-game menus <br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lJ9luTA.png" alt="" title=""></p></li><li><p>July 2016, released the game on <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/dungeon-mercenary/151692">GameJolt</a> and plugged with its achievements system: <br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YQwKAUt.png" alt="" title=""></p></li><li><p>September 2016, display the inventory alongside the map (and added <a href="http://i.imgur.com/iBrKanJ.gif">barrels</a> and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/2xN4msI.gif">forges</a>): <br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3hZDjdn.gif" alt="" title=""></p></li><li><p>September 2016, get rid of the monospaced font in the bottom panel: <br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HqV64hS.png" alt="" title=""></p></li><li><p>December 2016, added new special areas: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/s3f8i">throne rooms</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/yL1lSh4.gif">hand-written maps</a>, and the potion of negation: <img src="http://i.imgur.com/JJbTEPZ.png" alt="" title=""></p></li></ul> <h3 id="the-year-to-come">The year to come</h3> <p>Despite that creating an ASCII indie game is a very solitary experience, I’m pumped to continue, because my brain’s just throwing ideas continuously; and I’m not seeing that as a “one game” experience. My design is usually pretty generic, so I’m not feeling as “developing Dungeon Mercenary”, I’m feeling as “developing a framework for 2D grid games” which I’ll be able to instantiate to bring my ideas to life!</p> <p>So talk to you again soon!</p> <blockquote>  <p>Written with <a href="https://stackedit.io/">StackEdit</a>.</p></blockquote>
