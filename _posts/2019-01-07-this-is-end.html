<p>After three and a half years of indie gamedev (I wrote the first lines of code of <a href="https://hgames.itch.io/dungeon-mercenary">Dungeon Mercenary</a> at the end of August 2015), I’ve decided to stop my gamedev activity, i.e. the development of <a href="https://hgames.itch.io/rogue-vs-evil">Rogue vs Evil</a> after having released 2 versions of the demo. I started happy and I’m quitting happy. I’ve learnt a lot of things in the process, met very nice persons (not to mention Tommy Ettinger and <a href="https://twitter.com/MrStahlfelge">Mister Stahlfelge</a> and numerous others). But in the end, there’s not enough players playing my games.</p><p>I had hope that <strong>Rogue vs Evil</strong> would perform better than <strong>Dungeon Mercenary</strong>, because the former is a pixelart game while the latter is an asciiart one. But it doesn’t. After the release’s peak, both games have a similar number of views (which look like some noise):</p><p>Here’s the number of views of Dungeon Mercenary on itch, starting just before Rogue vs Evil’s release:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z1XXAUJ.png" alt=""><br>Here’s the number of views of Rogue vs Evil, starting at its release:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yIJ0ieJ.png" alt=""></p><p>Both games are performing poorly after the release’s peak and even Dungeon Mercenary plateau/noise is lower after Rogue vs Evil’s release than before (I don’t know why).</p><p>In addition, I received - what I perceive - few feedback, 2 persons commented on itch and circa 7~8 persons commented on reddit:</p><ul><li><a href="https://hgames.itch.io/rogue-vs-evil">https://hgames.itch.io/rogue-vs-evil</a> &lt;- see comments section at the bottom</li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/a020yz/released_first_demo_of_my_second_roguelike_game/">https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/a020yz/released_first_demo_of_my_second_roguelike_game/</a> &lt;- first release post</li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/achylz/updated_demo_of_rogue_vs_evil_third_dungeon/">https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/achylz/updated_demo_of_rogue_vs_evil_third_dungeon/</a> &lt;- post of second version of the demo</li></ul><p>I think itch shows the interest raises for <strong>general gamers</strong> while reddit shows the interest of players in the <strong>game’s niche</strong> (roguelikes). In both cases, it is below my expectations (which I had set at 5 persons commenting on itch and 10 persons commenting on reddit). I use to always have this project in a side of my brain, thinking what to do next and how to do it. But given the amount I feedback I receive, the time/mental engagement it requires to ship a game like Rogue vs Evil doesn’t feel worth it anymore.</p><p>I know my games aren’t really memorable in any way. Art is not awesome, controls are not awesome, content is not awesome: for example Dungeon Mercenary was always being compared to brogue and brogue is superior in so many ways, there’s not a lot of relevance to play Dungeon Mercenary, except for variety. I believe I’m capable of shipping <strong>okish games</strong>, but there’s so much competition out there that okish games don’t stand a chance. I knew beforehand it was going to be tough, I’ve done my best and failed; it’s okay: I’m glad I tried. If I hadn’t tried, I wouldn’t have learnt all this; and accepting failure is part of going forward!</p><p>So instead of <strong>working hard</strong> on my project (always trying to squeeze a little gamedev time there and there), I’ll <strong>sit back and relax</strong>: checkout the work of others, play games, and <strong>chill</strong> :-)</p><p>Adieu to everyone, thanks to supporters (thinking about /u/VedVid, cyndi4u, and <a href="https://twitter.com/damiencasoni">D. Casoni</a> to mention a few), and be sure to support other indie devs; there are thousand of awesome projects to discover :-)</p><blockquote><p>Written with <a href="https://stackedit.io/">StackEdit</a>.</p></blockquote>
