<p>I’m done implementing all runics in my game. First, there’s the boost runic, which is a generic runic that works like +x enchantments in D&amp;D/<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/">brogue</a>/<a href="http://www.amirrorclear.net/flowers/game/sil/">Sil</a>/you name it. So you can use it to boost the defense of a shield or armor, or increase the damages of weapons, or <em>and that’s where Dungeon Mercenary! differs from other games</em> you can use the boost runic to power-up a fancy runic. Fancy runics are:</p> <ul><li>Dragon slaying</li><li>Force</li><li>Lightning</li><li>Orc and goblins slaying</li><li>Paralysis</li><li>Poison</li><li>Quietus</li><li>Troll slaying</li><li>Undead slaying</li><li>Vampirisim</li></ul> <p>All <em>foo</em>-slaying runics increase you chance to beat a monster of this kind. More precisely each level of slaying works as a +3 boost level, against the considered class of monsters. The <a href="http://hgamesdev.blogspot.fr/2015/11/animations-for-quietus-and-force.html"><em>force</em></a> runic works as in <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/">brogue</a>: when it triggers the hit monster is pushed back (to a distance proportional to the runic’s level) away and takes damages if he’s stopped by a wall or another monster (the latter taking damages too). The <a href="http://hgamesdev.blogspot.fr/2015/11/runic-of-lightning.html"><em>lightning</em></a> runic hits the monster and any other adjacent monsters, up to <em>n</em> monsters; where <em>n</em> is the level of the runic. The <a href="http://hgamesdev.blogspot.fr/2015/12/runic-of-paralysis.html"><em>paralysis</em></a> runic paralyzes a monster for _n turns, where <em>n</em> is the level of the runic. This is powerful, because paralyzed monsters are hit automatically and take thrice damages while paralyzed. The poison runic poisons the hit monster for <em>n</em> turns where <em>n</em> is the level of the runic. At every turn, poisoned monsters take 1 hit point of damages (starting monsters have 5-7 hit points, while end game monsters will have 50-100). The <a href="http://hgamesdev.blogspot.fr/2015/11/animations-for-quietus-and-force.html"><em>quietus</em></a> runic has a chance to instantly kill the hit monster. Finally, the <em>vampirism</em> runic makes you gain a fraction of the damages you deal.</p> <p>All runics have the same chance of triggering: an <a href="http://hgamesdev.blogspot.com/2015/11/putting-runics-on-weapons.html">arithmetic probability</a>, starting at 10 for level 1; and decreasing by -1 with every level. So level 1 runic has 10% chance to trigger, level 2 has 10+9%, level 3 has 10+9+8, etc. Only the quietus runics has a different probability: the arithmetic probability is divided by 2, otherwise it’d be overpowered.</p> <p>With the combination of the boost runics and all the other runics, you can craft the weapon of your choice; being limited by the non-boost runics you find on your way to the deepest levels of the dungeon. As in brogue, I’d like the game to be winnable with as many combinations as possible, that is either by sinking all the boost runics on a single non-boost runic (+10 quietus anyone ?), to have the ultimate weapon of <em>foo</em>, or by distributing them to have a weapon that always provides some (low-level) runics. The strategy can also be tuned according to your weapon. Swords have a parry bonus, so you will get hit less often; axes have a parry penalty, but they make you hit all adjacent enemies at once, etc. In addition, because shields and armors can receive runics (where the effect applies when a monster hits your shield, as if he was hit by a weapon with the corresponding runics); you have the choice to play offensively (wielding two weapons is also an option) or defensively, runics-wise.</p> <p>I’ve been quite active on <a href="https://twitter.com/hgamesdev">my twitter account</a> lately.
