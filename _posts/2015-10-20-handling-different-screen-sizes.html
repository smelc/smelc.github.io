<p>In the roguelike I’m developing, I do not assume a given screen size; instead I adapt the display to the current screen size. For the moment I’ve only been testing with a 800x450 screen, but I simulate different screen sizes by changing the cells’ size. So here’s the game with the default size:</p> <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mwQ9VUs.png?1" alt="Map" title=""></p> <p>And then with a smaller cell size:</p> <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KDuxfHe.png" alt="Map with more cells" title=""></p> <p>The second screenshot shows how the status panel (the panel at the bottom) chooses its layout to put as much information as possible, hence the two columns for the monsters’ health bars.</p> <blockquote>  <p>Written with <a href="https://stackedit.io/">StackEdit</a>.</p></blockquote>
