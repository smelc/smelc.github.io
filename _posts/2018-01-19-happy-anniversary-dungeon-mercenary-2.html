<p>On this day, 2 years ago, I announced the first version of <a href="https://www.schplaf.org/hgames/">Dungeon Mercenary</a> on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/brogueforum/comments/41olu7/new_runicsbased_roguelike_dungeon_mercenary/?st=iy4grte2&amp;sh=139ea5e0">brogue’s reddit</a>. In this post, I’ll discuss how this year went (I did that <a href="http://hgamesdev.blogspot.com/2017/01/happy-anniversary-dungeon-mercenary.html">last year already</a>).</p> <p></p><center> <br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7vDhSzm.png" alt="" title=""> <br></center><p></p> <h3 id="statistics-about-the-second-year">Statistics about the second year</h3> <p>The game was released for the entire second year on my own website (where I do not track hits), <a href="https://hgames.itch.io/dungeon-mercenary">itch.io</a> and <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/dungeon-mercenary/151692">GameJolt</a>. During this second year, on <strong>itch.io</strong>, the game got 4385 views (for a total of 6959)(includes loading the HTML5 version of the game), 155 downloads (for a total of 314)(desktop version), and one 1€ donation (for a total of 2€). On <strong>GameJolt</strong>, the game got 1100 views (for a total of 4200), 469 plays (for a total of 1569). I earned 30 cents (for a total of 1,21€), thanks to GameJolt ads.</p> <p>So on itch the game gathered more views but more or less the same number of downloads. How can this be interpreted ? In 2017 I did only a single release, compared to many more the first year; so there could have been less momentum. But on itch there’s no peak, the views and downloads are the same all along the year. However, looking at how the game is found :</p> <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XC4yajJ.png" alt="itch stats" title=""></p> <p>and comparing with last year, the #1 referrer (itch’s random game button) disappeared. So it seems the views are incomparable. However, I would have supposed that having more relevant referrers would mean more downloads, but who knows :-(</p> <p>On GameJolt, the game received <strong>17 ratings</strong> (for a total of 68), for an average rating of 3,8 (out of 5 stars). The game received far less views and plays than the first year. The initial first week of the first year still weights a lot, since the game was on the frontpage back then.</p> <p>On July 2017, I released the game on <a href="https://www.kongregate.com/games/hgames/dungeon-mercenary">Kongregate</a> where it received circa 1000 plays the first month (when there’s an incentive for players to play the game and comment it, since they get some kind of credit for that) and it reached 1719 plays by the end of the year. I earned 1,83$ since the release, so it makes more than GameJolt.</p> <p>During the year, players had absolutely no interaction on the game’s page on itch (like last year), and like last year there was a little activity on GameJolt: a few comments on the game’s page and on the devlog. On Kongregate, there was <strong>circa 10 comments</strong>, but that’s because players have an incentive to do it I believe.</p> <p>In addition to itch’s 1€, I directly (i.e. via schplaf.org) received 18€ in 2 donations (so I guess it was something like 10€ before paypal’s fee); so I roughly <strong>made 20€ this year</strong> developing Dungeon Mercenary. I’ll let you decide whether it’s a lot or not, but it’s for sure pumping my motivation :-)</p> <p>Regarding the platforms, itch.io’s download counts shows that Windows 64 is ahead, but neither Windows 32 nor the standalone jar (Mac/Linux) are to be neglected:</p> <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6T4LP7Z.png" alt="itch download counts" title=""></p>   <h3 id="look-back-on-this-year">Look back on this year</h3> <ul><li>I switched my build system to <a href="https://gradle.org/">gradle</a> and it’s quite nice.</li><li>I started putting my code in the public domain, the main library being <a href="https://github.com/smelc/hgamesrhogue">hgamesrhogue</a>; that provides my dungeon generator. Did not get any feedback, but hey it’s there, you take it, you look at it, you steal the code, I don’t care :-)</li><li>I’ve done my first pixelart trials by plugging the dungeon generator to <a href="https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/">oryx’s sprites</a>: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/TkHBKJ4.png">pic1</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/gNVxxBh.gifv">gif1</a>.</li><li>Iterations are starting to take much longer, I spent <strong>190 days</strong> to make the June 2017 release. The next release, which will be no later than June 2018 (yep I’m guaranteeing it) will be close to a year long. I’m not adding that many systems though, but I’m just packing more content, and all the “easy to add” stuff has been done already.</li><li>I’ve started better <strong>organizing my notes</strong>. Instead of having a single file that ended mixing up TODOs and ideas; I now have a TODO.md file and an ideas.md file. I’ve organized the latter in sections (monsters, terrains, items, etc.). It was unplanned, but it helped me get the best of my ideas. Having similar ideas (say the possible new monsters) next to each other plus going over them regularly (because I update this list often and because I keep track of the current things I’m doing with IN-PROGRESS/DONE labels) made me <em>compare</em> my ideas regularly. My issue is not that I’m missing ideas, it’s that I should <strong>pick the best ones</strong>; and it takes some time to do so, because ideas are mitigated by how I can express them. In a graphicsless and soundless game, expressiveness is roughly limited to tinting, flashes, and text. Having similar ideas next to each other helped me <strong>classify them better</strong> and importantly helped me to rule out the weakest ones, even stuff that I thought I would do in the first place.</li></ul> <h3 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h3> <p>This year I’ve widened my inspiration sources. Before that I wasn’t looking a lot around, since I’m always so full of ideas; but it’s a bad habit.</p> <ul><li>I check out <a href="http://www.thegroundgivesway.com/"><em>The Ground Gives Way</em></a> webpage when I see updates on twitter. Its developer’s posts are very relevant to me and I like its content.</li><li>What’s really new is that I’ve immersed myself in my old collection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_Fantasy_Battle">Warhammer</a> armies books. I played a lot of it in high school and this year I started <em>enlarging</em> my list of books by buying the ones I do not have (7th edition) when there’s a good deal on ebay. These books are literally an endless source of inspiration. There’s a lot of basic rules, but  each army also come with its special rules/special units/rare items. So it’s good material both for the bestiary, for items, for spells: for almost everything besides narration and quests.</li><li>I’ve been watching youtubers about D&amp;D such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7XFmdssWgaPzGyGbKk8GaQ">WebDM</a> and Stefan Eremia’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CNonsense">CNonsense</a>. Good for erudition.</li></ul> <h3 id="diffusion">Diffusion</h3> <p>Like last year, I feel that it is very hard to get feedback and build a community. But the good news is that two people did a <em>Let’s Play</em> without me asking for anything, that’s nice!</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByvAud_2raU">Nookrium</a> who put the link to my GameJolt page and it immediately triggered circa a hundred of views (the video had 2000 views when I saw the peak).</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0_qNQflwmM">Jr Todd</a></li></ul> <p>Regarding social websites:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/hgamesdev">twitter</a> still seems like the #1 place to communicate as there’s a lot of people there.</li><li>For some reason, the game never seems to attract discussions when I post on reddit. In particular on  roguelikedev’s <em>Sharing Saturday</em>. Maybe my visuals do not stand out enough, I don’t know.</li><li>The audience on <a href="https://hgamesdev.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a> is slowly growing, I’m often having new followers. I don’t understand that website and the content is pretty weird, but I nevertheless publish my devlog on it.</li><li>My social process is as follows: I always update my twitter account first and when I have time I push a single devlog entry to all other devlogs: <a href="https://hgames.itch.io/dungeon-mercenary/devlog">itch’s devlog</a>, <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/dungeon-mercenary/151692/devlog">GameJolt’s devlog</a>, and tumblr. I had some feedback on GameJolt and I know that some people are following. On the other websites, I have no idea.</li><li>When showing the first pixelart trials there was no noticeable audience increase.</li></ul>   <h3 id="this-year">This Year</h3> <p>This year I’ll do a single release, which will happen in May or in June. It’ll bring a lot of stuff: better dungeons (since I generate my owns now), <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pWY773k.gifv">ranged attackers</a>, new mini quests (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/alH1xXs.png">pic1</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/egi66G1.png">pic2</a>), <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Rf5phDn.gif">new interactions</a>, new flavorful monsters, new potions (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/m4Rv1WG.gifv">potion of many colors</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bOrIbon.gifv">potion of stone heart</a>). It won’t be the end of the road, but it’ll be a good release :-)</p> <p>After that I’ll work on a <strong>spinoff</strong>. It’ll be the same codebase, but I’ll instantiate some things differently; and so it’ll be a different game. Stay tuned and spread the love of small roguelikes :-) ❤</p> <blockquote>  <p>Written with <a href="https://stackedit.io/">StackEdit</a>.</p></blockquote>
