<p><a href="http://hgamesdev.blogspot.com/2018/01/happy-anniversary-dungeon-mercenary-2.html">Like last year</a> I’ll do a recap on the stats of my games: Dungeon Mercenary and <a href="https://hgames.itch.io/rogue-vs-evil">Rogue vs Evil</a>, the latter being my new game; released solely on itch (and soon to be released on Google’s play store).</p><h1 id="statistics-about-the-third-year">Statistics about the third year</h1><h2 id="dungeon-mercenary">Dungeon Mercenary</h2><p>Dungeon Mercenary got <strong>7241 views</strong> (for a total of 14200), which is more than last year (during which it got 4385). There was no donation in 2018. On GameJolt the game got <strong>400 views</strong> (for a total of 4600). It’s less than last year when it got <strong>1100 views</strong>. I earned <strong>8 cents</strong> (for a total of 1.29), thanks to GameJolt ads.</p><p>On itch, the game gathered more views, mostly thanks to the ““peak”” caused by the release of Rogue vs Evil:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z1XXAUJ.png" alt=""><br>Compared to the previous years, Dungeon Mercenary got comments on itch; from <strong>4 different persons</strong>. I posted a devlog entry every week, gathering circa <strong>20 comments</strong>.</p><p>The release had nice new content (well according to me :-): ranged attackers, new enemies, new special rooms. The release did not yield a big momentum:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AcbHp5t.png" alt=""><br>The release happened on April 29 and the data here spans two months, from April 15 to June 15. So there was a small peak at the release, and then the views and downloads were slightly higher; but by a small difference.</p><p>Here’s how the visitors find the game on itch:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MlWCP3Z.png" alt=""><br>It’s mostly similar to last year’s data.</p><p>On GameJolt, the game got <strong>3 ratings</strong> (for a total of 71). This is less than last year (when it got 17 ratings), but I believe that’s because GameJolt stopped proposing ratings. It features likes now (of which Dungeon Mercenary has 62).</p><p>Here’s how the different platforms performed on itch:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NkhY2Xv.png" alt=""><br>That’s more than last year in which windows 64 got 78 downloads, windows 32 got 20 downloads, and the raw jar (linux/mac) got 34 downloads.</p><h2 id="rogue-vs-evil">Rogue vs Evil</h2><p><a href="https://hgames.itch.io/rogue-vs-evil">Rogue vs Evil</a> is my second game, which I started right after Dungeon Mercenary April’s release. It is the same codebase as Dungeon Mercenary, but I changed quite a few things:</p><ul><li>There’s a world map/overworld:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LM1VDAj.png" alt=""></li><li>The runics system is simplified, items cannot be boosted anymore with runics. I did that because the code to generate the descriptions of runics was growing too complex and I could not hand it over to translators.</li><li>There are different disconnected dungeons, instead of a single giant dungeon</li><li>It uses pixelart instead of asciiart.</li></ul><p>Here are the stats, from the release of the demo; to the end of 2018:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yIJ0ieJ.png" alt=""><br>I announced the game on social media:</p><ul><li>twitter and tumblr</li><li>on itch and gamejolt (Dungeon Mercenary’s devlog)</li><li>on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/a020yz/released_first_demo_of_my_second_roguelike_game/">reddit</a></li></ul><p>reddit was the main provider of visitors, together with itch; but I don’t know where the game was listed on itch, maybe there’s some “new games” section.</p><p>The game got comments from <strong>8 persons</strong> on reddit and from <strong>1 person</strong> on itch. This was disappointing as I was aiming for 10 persons on reddit and 5 persons on itch. Another disappointing thing is that the game isn’t attracting more players (after the initial release burst) than Dungeon Mercenary on itch. I was expecting that a pixelart game would attract more views than an asciiart one; but it seems I’m wrong. Ultimately I think the views are just some “noise” and that there is virtually no interested players after the release burst.</p><p>Here are where incoming visits come for Rogue vs Evil (last 30 days, hence after the release burst):<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hXkw468.png" alt=""><br>I believe the first referrer is the itch widget embedded on my website: <a href="https://www.schplaf.org/hgames/">schplaf.org/hgames/</a> but I’m not sure as <a href="http://schplaf.org">schplaf.org</a> is listed below too.</p><p>Here’s the list of downloads per platform:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2BDHfV0.png" alt=""></p><p>So it seems the numbers for Rogue vs Evil are vaguely similar to what Dungeon Mercenary gets.</p><h1 id="look-back-on-this-year">Look back on this year</h1><ul><li>I automated uploading my games to <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a> using itch’s tool butler; it was nice.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx">libgdx</a>’s APIs for pixelart are nice</li><li>I did some pixelart, to complete the assets I’ve bought. It was surprisingly fun to do, because I was using 16x16 assets. Any larger size (such 24x24) would have been impracticable for me (not an artist at all, I can’t draw anything by hand)</li><li>I added support for Android (to be released) for Rogue vs Evil. It was surprisingly easy and fast (although I had the constraints in mind since the beginning of my codebase)</li></ul><h1 id="this-year">This year</h1><p>I will publish Rogue vs Evil’s demo on Google’s play store, because I’ve already paid the 25$ fee and everything is almost completely ready.</p><p>Then I’ll stop my gamedev activity. To put it quick, I’ll have more fun playing games than writing games; because I’ve come to the conclusion that the mental/time investment it requires to write polished games isn’t worth the feedback I get. This feeling started tickling me 6 months ago and the fact that Rogue vs Evil did not perform better than Dungeon Mercenary made me reach the conclusion.</p><p>I’ll write a postmortem post later in the hope to write something useful for aspiring gamedevs. Until that, take care and thanks for reading that far! Love to indie devs and roguelikes ❤️</p><blockquote><p>Written with <a href="https://stackedit.io/">StackEdit</a>.</p></blockquote>
