<p>As planned, last week I coded generation of runics and their integration on weapons. It was pretty straightforward. I again put my generic buttons panel to use (that made it to <a href="https://github.com/SquidPony/SquidLib/pull/97">SquidLib</a>). This time there was a variation, because I wanted the panel to be of the form:</p> <pre>header<br />                button1<br />         longer button2<br />                    etc<br /></pre> <p>i.e. I wanted a text header and right-aligned buttons. I was a bit puzzled at first and started adding a custom setting to make the panel “jump” a configurable number of lines at the top (to allow to typeset the header afterwards), but wasn’t happy with the resulting API (that offer already a lot of configuration already: inter-buttons padding, x/y padding around text, colors, sizes of borders (the rounded ones), etc.). Ultimately I just added a Set of indexes of buttons that should not be plugged (i.e. that should not receive a keyboard shortcut), i.e. that are just text and I added an array to allow to specify the alignment of buttons individually (left/center/right). Good thing is, as the header is just an unplugged button, the panel’s internal computation of its size still works and doesn’t care of the header’s status.</p> <p>Before that, all options were configured with builders-like methods (<code>this.foo := newVal; return this;</code>), but the class’ API was getting crowded, so I just made all the corresponding fields public, with good documentation. Because they are all values (ints, Booleans), safety isn’t really a concern and anyway this is a game library, not the core of some super-intensive/safety critical program; so I’m in favor of a few well-placed public fields instead of spamming trivial methods. Anyway enough chitchat, here’s the result:</p> <p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QyASC_SXQZw?feature=player_detailpage" allowfullscreen="" height="360" width="640"></iframe></p> <p>I’ve used the greek ‘rho’ letter for runics. When stepping on a runic, either you apply it right away (click in the menu) or leave it there (dispatching the menu/moving). Of course for testing purposes I’ve spammed runics all over. There’ll be less of them in the real game.</p> <p>Next I’ll code stairs and multiple levels.</p> <blockquote>  <p>Written with <a href="https://stackedit.io/">StackEdit</a>.</p></blockquote>
